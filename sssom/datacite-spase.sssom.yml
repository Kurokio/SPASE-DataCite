mapping_set_description: This mapping set is a manually curated work to map from the Space Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE) language to DataCite. Property alignment was created using the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM; https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/home/). The motivation of this mapping is to inform an automated transformation from SPASE to DataCite for use by data repositories to expose their holdings to data aggregators and search engines. A high degree of precision was attempted.
